# PARP1-and-CDK8-Inhibitor-Treatment-in-OVCAR #
# OVCAR3 and OVCAR4 Cell Lines #

**This repository consists of RNA-seq analysis done on highgrade serous ovarian cancer cell lines (OVCAR3 & OVCAR4), to study the independent effects of PARP1 or CDK8 inhibition on cancer cell growth.**

The RNA-seq workflow consists of these stages:

* QC Filtering
* Processing
* Alignment
* Differential Expresion analysis using CuffDiff
* Data Visualization

**Output:** Venn diagrams, Volcano plot and heatmaps for differentially expressed genes
